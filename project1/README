1. Create playable game, with state transitions
	* Create ASCII grid
	* Fix communication GRID/PLAYER (i.e. letters->coords)

		- Look up game rules
		- No legal moves outside of grid
		- Only legal moves when encapsulating other player's bricks

	* Communicate legal moves to player
	* Create point system for states
	* Provide option menu (i.e. player start/AI starts, yield, etc.)
	* Create visualization of game state

2. Create minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
	* Create algorithm
	* Introduce time limit to algorithm
	* Create bookkeeping of time used for reasoning
